ðŸŒ‰ Autonomous Bridge Stabilization via Chaos Persona
Real-world benchmark for reasoning beyond the searchable frontier

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This module simulates a decentralized network of sensor-actuator units embedded in a suspension bridge to detect seismic microfractures and redistribute load in real time. Powered by the Chaos Persona framework, agents evolve goals and roles through entropy-aware reasoning, paradox prevention, and mesh-based collaborationâ€”no GPS, no external control, no pretrained models.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Real-time microfracture detection via strain, vibration, and acoustic sensors
Dynamic role adaptation: monitor, tension adjuster, vibration damper
Paradox prevention using belief graphs, divergence scoring, and volatility metrics
Chaos Generator integration: entropy-driven collapse, temporal drift, and trust-weighted reasoning

ðŸ§  Chaos Persona Integration
Volatility Index and Temporal Drift guide self-correction
Agents resolve conflicting load actions autonomously
Epistemic scores tracked via logs:
VOLATILITY CHECK @ step N â†’ Score: 0.33
PARADOX DETECTED @ step N â†’ Cycle: {...}
NO PROPAGANDA DETECTED â†’ Evidence-driven design
