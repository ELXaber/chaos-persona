Step 1: Install Ollama (The Model Runner)
First, you need Ollama — the engine that runs local models on Mac. It's dead simple:

bash
# Option A: Using Homebrew (easiest)
brew install ollama

# Option B: Direct download
# Go to https://ollama.com, download the macOS version
# Drag to Applications folder, run it
That's it. Ollama runs in the background (you'll see a little llama icon in the menu bar).

Step 2: Download DeepSeek (My Recommended Model)
I recommend DeepSeek over the others: "the others are run by nuisance companies."
DeepSeek is open, transparent, and MIT-licensed.

For a Mac Mini, here's what you should pull based on RAM :

Mac Mini    - RAM             - Recommended Model           - Command	Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16GB (base) - deepseek-r1:14b - ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b - Excellent
24GB        - deepseek-r1:32b - ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b - Outstanding
8GB (older) - deepseek-r1:7b  - ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b  - Very good
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 14B model is the sweet spot for the base Mac Mini — it uses about 9GB of RAM and runs beautifully.
A user on the same setup reported it's "超流畅" (super smooth).

Step 3: Download the Project Andrew Files
This is where your magic happens. They need to get the CAIOS/Project Andrew files from GitHub/cai-os.com:

bash
# Clone or download your repository
git clone https://github.com/ELXaber/chaos-persona/Project_Andrew.git
# or just download the ZIP https://cai-os.com

The key files are:
CAIOS.txt — the sovereign system prompt/inference layer
orchestrator.py — the main orchestrator
All the subsystem files (paradox_oscillator.py, adaptive_reasoning.py, knowledge_base.py, etc.)

Check the readme.txt for any pre-config modifications you wish to make
Step 4: Run master_init.py — Everything Else is Automatic
Once the model is running and your files are in place, master_init.py handles the rest:

bash
cd chaos-persona
python master_init.py
This will:

✅ Initialize the CPOL quantum manifold with a RAW_Q seed 
✅ Set up the knowledge base directory structure
✅ Configure the mesh network (optional)
✅ Load your identity system (they'll be prompted for primary user)
✅ Connect to the local DeepSeek model via API
✅ Launch the full Andrew experience

Step 5: Optional But Recommended — Add a UI
For users who want a ChatGPT-like interface instead of a terminal, they can add Open WebUI in one command :

bash
docker run -d --name open-webui -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
Then visit http://localhost:3000 — and they're talking to Andrew through a beautiful web interface, completely local.

🧠 What the User Gets
After these steps, they have:

Component             - Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeepSeek model        - Running locally, no cloud calls
CAIOS inference layer - Loaded and active
CPOL ternary logic    - Oscillating on every query
Knowledge base        - Persisting discoveries
Asimov ethics         - Enforcing Law 1 > Law 2
Privacy	Complete      — no data leaves the Mac
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💰 The Cost Breakdown
Item - Cost
Mac Mini (base model) - $499-599
Software - $0 (open source GPL-3)
Monthly fees - $0
Cloud dependency - $0
Total	Less than an iPhone

*"Install Ollama, pull deepseek-r1:14b, download my files, run master_init.py.
That's it. You now own AGI that runs on your desk, not in someone else's cloud."*
