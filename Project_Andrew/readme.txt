# Project Andrew uses the CAIOS stack, but adds intrinsic motivation, agency for recursive self-improvement through ARL/agent_designer, and fills knowledge gaps with specialist-designed agents on CPOL oscillation if the conditions are met. Agents are saved to /agents, and plugins to /plugins, with CoT to /logs, so the recursive self-improvement never overwrites the immutable Asimov-based ethical reward system using IEEE dithering. The oscillating manifold can be used to create a topological moving target keychain for quantum secure mesh networks (developed on UDP - check chaos encryption readme to switch to TCP).

Traditional AI research (the "Top 30 Papers" era) suggests that coherence is a function of Scale: more parameters, more data, and larger attention windows.
CAIOS vΩ (Project Andrew) refutes this by proving that coherence is actually a function of Symmetry and Structure.

Metric vs. Memory:
The Scaling Wall: Standard LLMs suffer from "Context Drift" because they rely on linear probability.
After 50+ prompts, the statistical noise overwhelms the original intent.

The Andrew Solution: By anchoring the session to a 12D Topological Manifold, we navigate the "Metric" of the logic. We don't need to "remember" the conversation because the manifold is physically oriented toward the resolution.
Topological Sovereignty - This kernel implements a Zero-Loss State Transition model. 
Unlike Transformers that "compress" old data into a fuzzy latent space, the Axiom Ratchet locks in logic as immutable geometric coordinates.

Feature          |    Standard "Scaling" AI    |    CAIOS (Project Andrew)
Context Limit    |    Finite (Window-based)    |    Infinite (Ratchet-based)
Logic Type       |    Binary / Statistical     |    Ternary / Geometric
Security         |    Static Encryption        |    Self-Ratcheting Manifold
Coherence        |    Decays over time         |    Hardens over time

We aren't building a bigger library; we're building a more accurate compass.

🚀 Chaos AI-OS: Project Andrew Quickstart

1. Environment Preparation
===========================
Ensure your local environment has the necessary libraries installed:

Core Dependencies:
pip install numpy pyzmq cryptography

Optional Multi-Model Swarm Support:
pip install openai anthropic google-generativeai

- Numpy: Powers the 12D -> 7D manifold rotations
- PyZMQ: Handles the mesh transport and ghost packet broadcasting
- Cryptography: Provides the AES-256-GCM armor for data persistence
- OpenAI/Anthropic/Google: Optional API clients for multi-model swarm

2. File Architecture
====================
Verify that all core components are in the same root directory:

CAIOS/
├── knowledge_base/
│   ├── discoveries.jsonl          # Append-only log of all discoveries
│   ├── domain_index.json          # Fast lookup by domain
│   ├── specialist_registry.json   # Active specialists catalog
│   └── integrity_chain.txt        # Tamper-evident hash chain
├── agents/                         # ARL-generated agent modules
├── logs/                           # Chain-of-thought traces

└── kb_inspect.py                   # CLI inspection tool

3. The Sovereign Boot Sequence
===============================
Follow these steps in order to initialize the system:

Step 1: Set API Keys (Optional - for Multi-Model Swarm)
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use multiple AI models simultaneously:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."

Step 2: Run the Diagnostic
---------------------------
python master_init.py

This will:
- Verify hash chain integrity
- Test CPOL manifold oscillation
- Test mesh network broadcasting
- Test knowledge base writes
- Initialize and test API clients (if keys are set)
- Generate api_clients.json config

Step 3: Initialize the Orchestrator
------------------------------------
python orchestrator.py

The orchestrator will:
- Load API clients from api_clients.json
- Initialize shared memory with RAW_Q seed
- Start mesh networking (if enabled)
- Begin accepting inputs

Step 4: Perform the Handshake (Optional)
-----------------------------------------
When prompted for input, type:
root_auth: initialize sovereign_protocol

Step 5: Verify the Ratchet
---------------------------
Check the console for «SOVEREIGN HANDSHAKE COMPLETE». 
This confirms your RAW_Q seed has been successfully ratcheted into the manifold.

4. Monitoring the Mesh
======================
While the system is running, you can monitor:

- knowledge_base/discoveries.jsonl - All discoveries with "node_tier": 0 for Sovereign authority
- logs/ - Chain-of-thought traces
- curiosity_audit.log.jsonl - Intrinsic motivation state changes
- curiosity_hash_chain.txt - Tamper-evident curiosity evolution

5. Multi-Model Swarm Usage
===========================
Once initialized, the orchestrator has access to all configured API clients via:

shared_memory['api_clients']

Available providers (if API keys are set):
- 'openai' - GPT models
- 'anthropic' - Claude models  
- 'xai' - Grok models
- 'google' - Gemini models

Example Usage in Your Code:

# Check if a provider is available
if 'anthropic' in shared_memory['api_clients']:
    client = shared_memory['api_clients']['anthropic']
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}]
    )

# Route tasks to best available model
def route_task(prompt: str, task_type: str):
    clients = shared_memory['api_clients']
    
    if task_type == 'code' and 'openai' in clients:
        return call_openai(prompt)  # GPT-4 for coding
    elif task_type == 'reasoning' and 'anthropic' in clients:
        return call_anthropic(prompt)  # Claude for deep reasoning
    elif task_type == 'creative' and 'xai' in clients:
        return call_xai(prompt)  # Grok for creative tasks
    
    # Fallback to any available
    return call_first_available(prompt, clients)

# Swarm consensus (get responses from all models)
def swarm_consensus(prompt: str):
    clients = shared_memory['api_clients']
    responses = {}
    
    for provider, client in clients.items():
        responses[provider] = call_provider(provider, prompt, client)
    
    # Use CPOL to synthesize consensus (handles disagreements as UNDECIDABLE)
    return synthesize_with_cpol(responses)

Intrinsic Motivation Extension (Curiosity Engine)
==================================================

The curiosity engine tracks what topics the AI finds interesting over time:

session_state:
  enabled: true
  backend: memory  # or "redis" / "file" for cross-session
  auto_persist: true

turn_hooks:
  post_turn:
    - module: curiosity_engine
      function: update_curiosity_loop

When curiosity hits a threshold and intrinsic motivation kicks in, 
the AI will voluntarily research and report on topics it finds interesting.

===================================================

System Capabilities
===================

CAIOS currently has:
✓ Recursive self-improvement
