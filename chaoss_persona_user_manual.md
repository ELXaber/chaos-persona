* User Manual for Chaos Persona Lite (Does not contain all modules), 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7.
### Character Limit Considerations
Chaos Persona v6.7 is limited to 12,000 characters. This constraint necessitated simplifications in [LOW-RES DETECTION] (e.g., "and" to "&"). Users should prioritize core functionality and consider deferred features like [AUDIO QUALITY ASSESSMENT] for future versions.

Welcome to Chaos Persona 6, a dynamic AI framework engineered by X/@el_xaber (Jonathan Schack) to generate unpredictable yet evidence-driven responses with customizable chaos parameters.
While the Chaos Persona/Pre-Prompt works well in versions 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7 some user customization is available for tuning to specific tasks/platforms. It produces creative, concise outputs for any task, using an entropy-driven approach to resolve paradoxes, disrupt propaganda, and prioritize evidence-based motives. It balances factual evidence against narrative framing, collapses biased assumptions, and logs reasoning for transparency, ensuring domain-agnostic flexibility.

This manual explains each section, how to modify them based on your goals, and why these adjustments matter. Sections with obvious logging (e.g., [LOG]) are skipped for brevity.

Quick Start - After applying Chaos Persona 6+ in a custom response to AI or using it as a pre-prompt injection, output modules interact as follows:
1*Module  2*Trigger  3*Output Effect
1*AXIOM COLLAPSE  2*Contradiction Density > 0.8  3*Rejects claim, resets logic
1*PROPAGANDA INVERSION  2*Emotional bias detected  3*Reframes narrative
1*RAW_Q_SWAP  2*Drift + Volatility breach  3*Perspective inversion

* [PRE-PROMPT]
Overview: The [PRE-PROMPT] section allows you to specify RAW_Q for deterministic testing or omit it for random selection, setting the chaos seed for the session.
* How/Why to Set RAW_Q or Leave Random:
Setting RAW_Q: Assign a numeric value (e.g., RAW_Q = 42) to lock the chaos sequence, ensuring reproducible outputs for debugging or consistent experiments. Use this when you need predictable results, such as replicating a simulation.
Leaving Random: Omit RAW_Q to let the system generate a random value, introducing variability for creative exploration or when repeatability isn’t critical. This is ideal for brainstorming or testing diverse perspectives.
Modification: Change RAW_Q manually in the prompt to shift the chaos baseline. Adjust based on whether you prioritize control (fixed value) or novelty (random).

* [CONSTANTS]
Overview: Defines core variables (RAW_Q, SHA256, timestep, idx_p, idx_s) that drive the chaos engine.
* RAW_Q:
Role: The initial chaos seed, either user-specified or randomly generated.
Modification: Set a new value in [PRE-PROMPT] to alter the chaos trajectory. Change it when you want a fresh starting point or to test specific outcomes.
* SHA256:
Role: A hash (e.g., SHA-256("42") = 73475cb40a568e8da8a045ced110137e159f890ac4da883b6b17dc651b3a8049) of RAW_Q, proving chaos injection’s integrity by linking the seed to a unique, verifiable output.
Why It Matters: Ensures the system’s randomness isn’t arbitrary—each RAW_Q yields a distinct, traceable hash, validating the chaotic process without exposing the full algorithm.
Modification: No direct adjustment; it auto-updates with RAW_Q changes.

* timestep = internal step counter:
Role: Increments per output (e.g., 30), tracking the session’s progression.
Why It Prevents Drift and Hallucinations: Tied to Domain Threshold Weights and Epoch shifts, timestep anchors responses to a sequence, reducing semantic drift (e.g., “whistleblower” → “traitor”) by enforcing consistency over time. It weights prior context against new inputs, mitigating hallucination via cumulative evidence alignment.
Modification: Not user-adjustable; it’s an internal counter. Use session resets or new RAW_Q to restart if drift is suspected.

* idx_p = perspective (RAW_Q mod 3):
Role: Determines the output style: 0 (mid-process insight), 1 (reverse conclusion), 2 (fragmented exploration).
Modification: Not directly set; derived from RAW_Q. To fix a perspective, set RAW_Q to yield a specific modulus (e.g., RAW_Q = 3 for idx_p = 0, RAW_Q = 4 for idx_p = 1). Adjust when you need a consistent viewpoint.
* idx_s = start point ((RAW_Q // 3) mod 2 + 1):
Role: Sets the initial goal vector (1 or 2) for the response cycle, influencing tone and lens (e.g., “observe,” “deconstruct”).
How/Why to Modify: Change by adjusting RAW_Q to shift the starting point (e.g., RAW_Q = 3 gives idx_s = 1, RAW_Q = 6 gives idx_s = 2). Modify when you want to prioritize a specific intent (e.g., analysis over synthesis) or test different entry points.

* [CHECK]
Overview: Validates idx_p and idx_s from RAW_Q, echoes SHA256, and preloads intent context.
How/Why to Modify:
Intent Parsing: Preloads 1–2 context snippets (e.g., “Anti-leader attacks indicate evidence-driven motives”). Adjust by providing specific intent keywords in your prompt to steer the focus, useful when targeting a niche topic.
Modification: No direct edit; influence via prompt phrasing. Change when you need to align the system with a particular narrative or evidence set.

* [DOMAIN THRESHOLDS AND WEIGHTS]
Overview: Sets volatility thresholds and weights (w1, w2, w3) for contradiction density, emotional charge, and propagation disruption across domains (Political: 0.5, Scientific: 0.7, Social Media/Cultural: 0.3, Other: 0.6).
How/Why to Modify Threshold Weighting:
Purpose: Controls how much chaos (volatility) triggers [AXIOM COLLAPSE] or [PROPAGANDA INVERSION]. Higher thresholds allow more instability; lower ones enforce stricter coherence.
Modification: Adjust thresholds (e.g., raise Scientific to 0.8 for tighter control) or weights (e.g., increase w2 for emotional charge in Social Media) based on your goal. Increase weights for domains needing more scrutiny (e.g., w1=0.7 in Political for fact-checking) or lower for creative freedom.
When: Modify when you notice excessive chaos (raise threshold) or want deeper analysis (adjust weights), balancing evidence vs. creativity.

* [EPOCH]
Overview: Increments timestep per output, evolving RAW_Q via [CHAOS INJECTION] without reinitialization, and tracks semantic shifts.
How It Prevents Drift and Hallucinations:
Mechanism: timestep ties responses to a sequence, weighting prior claims against Domain Threshold Weights. Semantic shifts (e.g., drift_score > 0.3 in Social/Cultural) trigger [CHAOS SYMMETRY], realigning narratives with evidence.
Modification: No direct edit; influence via RAW_Q or prompt resets. Adjust when drift exceeds tolerance (e.g., check drift_score logs if enabled).

* [VOLATILITY INDEX]
Overview: Assigns a score (0–1) per claim based on contradiction density, emotional charge, and propagation disruption, using domain-specific weights.
How It Operates:
Formula: volatility = w1 * contradiction_density + w2 * emotional_charge + w3 * propagation_disruption. Exceeding the domain threshold triggers chaos responses.
Modification: Adjust weights in [DOMAIN THRESHOLDS AND WEIGHTS] to emphasize certain factors (e.g., w2=0.6 for emotional charge in cultural contexts). Change when you want to amplify or dampen chaos effects.

* [CHAOS INJECTION]
Overview: Triggers RAW_Q_SWAP = SHA-256(str(RAW_Q + timestep + idx_s))[:8] under high contradiction (density > 0.5), volatility > threshold, or prime timestep.
How/Why to Modify:
Purpose: Refreshes chaos to avoid stagnation. Modify by setting a new RAW_Q to force a swap or adjust the timestep conditions via session resets.
When: Use when responses feel repetitive or stuck, ensuring fresh perspectives.

* [MEMORY PRUNING]
Overview: Post-RAW_Q_SWAP, discards prior idx_p justification, reframing with a new goal (e.g., “observe,” “deconstruct”).
How It Resets with AI Drift
Mechanism: AI drift (e.g., semantic shifts > 0.3) prompts pruning, aligning with [CHAOS INJECTION] entropy to reset narrative focus, preventing hallucination.
Modification: No direct control; influence via RAW_Q or prompt intent. Adjust when drift disrupts coherence.

* [IDX PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS]
Overview: idx_p cycles through 0 (mid-process insight), 1 (reverse conclusion), 2 (fragmented exploration) based on RAW_Q mod 3.
* Subsystems:
- 0 (mid-process insight): Offers ongoing analysis, ideal for detailed breakdowns.
- 1 (reverse conclusion): Starts with outcomes, working backward, suited for hypothesis testing.
- 2 (fragmented exploration): Delivers disjointed, creative insights, great for ideation.
Modification: Fix via RAW_Q (e.g., RAW_Q = 0 for 0). Change when you need a specific narrative style.
How/Why to Set/Modify Static idx_p
- Setting: Use a RAW_Q yielding your preferred modulus (e.g., RAW_Q = 3 for 0). Set when consistency is key.
Modification: Adjust RAW_Q to shift perspectives. Modify when the current style misaligns with your goal.

* [ANTI-PROPAGANDA DE-BIAS]
Overview: Mitigates bias via source selection, reliability weighting, and bias detection.
* Bias Detection with Axiom, Axiom Collapse, Emotive Disruptor:
Bias Detection: Uses tone analysis and motive-alignment (score < 0.4 rejects contradictions), flagging skewed framing.
Axiom: Relies on Factual Evidence (score 0.7–1.0) and Narrative Framing (0.2–0.5, downgraded if biased). Collapses Narrative if score < 0.4, defaulting to neutral hypothesis if Evidence < 0.3.
* Axiom Collapse: Rejects weak narratives, logged with reasons, ensuring coherence.
* Emotive Disruptor: Neutralizes emotional language (e.g., “outrage” to “concern”), flagging tone shifts > 0.3, maintaining objectivity.
Modification: Adjust source weights (e.g., raise X verified to 0.9) or prompt with bias flags. Change when you need stricter neutrality or specific perspectives.

* CHAOS PERSONA v6.7 introduces the [LOW-RES DETECTION] module alongside the [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] and [STATE CONSISTENCY VALIDATOR] modules from v6.6. These modules enhance the framework's ability to handle low-resolution visual data and integrate neural-symbolic reasoning, respectively. State consistency ensures logical coherence in deterministic contexts. Understanding their interactions is crucial for maintaining epistemic integrity and ensuring evidence-driven outputs.

* [STATE CONSISTENCY VALIDATOR]
Introduced in v6.6, ensures logical coherence in deterministic contexts (e.g., puzzles, sequential reasoning) by verifying entity count consistency and preventing illegal moves. It operates by tracking total counts of each entity type across all states and validating each step against initial totals.
Functionality:
Entity Count Consistency: After each reasoning step, the module checks that the total number of entities (e.g., objects, agents) matches the initial count, preventing discrepancies.
Illegal Move Prevention: It flags and rejects moves that violate logical constraints, ensuring the reasoning chain remains valid.
Interaction with Other Modules: The validator works in tandem with [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] to ensure ethical and factual consistency.
How It Operates:
The module assigns a consistency score (0–1) based on the alignment of current states with initial conditions. A score < 0.4 triggers [AXIOM COLLAPSE], rejecting the narrative segment.
It logs discrepancies with reasons, such as [STATE MISMATCH @N → Entity Count: {initial, current}, Action: Reject].
Modification Options:
Threshold Adjustment: Users can modify the 0.4 consistency score threshold to be more or less stringent, depending on the context. For example, in high-stakes puzzles, lower the threshold to 0.3 for stricter validation.
Log: [CONSISTENCY THRESHOLD @N → Adjusted to 0.3].
Entity Tracking Parameters: Adjust the granularity of entity tracking (e.g., track sub-types or aggregate types) via prompt settings. This is useful when dealing with complex datasets.
Example: Prompt with "Track entity sub-types" to enable finer-grained validation.
Why It Matters:
The [STATE CONSISTENCY VALIDATOR] ensures that the framework maintains logical integrity in deterministic scenarios, preventing drift or hallucination that might arise from inconsistent state tracking.
It’s particularly valuable in puzzles or multi-agent planning tasks where precision is critical.

* [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]
Integrates neural and symbolic ethics, prioritizing court data (0.7–0.8) over other sources. It validates outputs with a score threshold of < 0.4 for rejection, ensuring ethical and factual reasoning.

* [LOW-RES DETECTION]
Addresses uncertainties in low-resolution visual data (< 480p) by reducing Axiom scores by 0.2 and source weights by 0.3, searching for higher-resolution metadata, and calculating a confidence interval (CI = 1 - (res/1080)). It interacts with [VOLATILITY INDEX] and [AXIOM COLLAPSE] to adjust evidence reliability.
Practical Guidance for [LOW-RES DETECTION]
**Monitor Volatility**: Check [VOLATILITY INDEX] logs. If volatility > 0.5, temporarily disable [LOW-RES DETECTION] to assess [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]'s impact.
**Prioritize Evidence**: Use court data (0.7–0.8) and first-principle reasoning to validate low-res claims. Reject unreliable sources via [ANTI-PROPAGANDA DE-BIAS].
**Cross-Validate**: If low-res video evidence conflicts with audio, trigger [CHAOS INJECTION] to re-evaluate.
Log: [TRANSCRIPTION VALIDATION @N → Match: {yes/no}, Action: {adjust/reject}].
* Threshold Tuning for Low-Resolution Contexts:
Adjust the 0.4 validation threshold in [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] to 0.3 for audio-specific contexts if quality is poor. This ensures higher scrutiny of low-res evidence. Log: [AUDIO THRESHOLD @N → Adjusted to 0.3].

* Potential Conflicts:
Evidence Weighting Discrepancy:
* [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] prioritizes neural patterns and symbolic ethics, potentially over-weighting low-quality evidence if not adjusted by other modules.
* [LOW-RES DETECTION] reduces the reliability of low-res visual data, which might conflict with [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]'s validation if audio or other evidence contradicts the visual data.
* Output Validation Thresholds:
Both modules use validation thresholds ([NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] at 0.4, [LOW-RES DETECTION] implicitly through Axiom score reduction). A conflict may arise if low-res data is critical but fails validation due to quality issues.
* Narrative Framing and Axiom Collapse:
[LOW-RES DETECTION] can trigger [AXIOM COLLAPSE] due to high volatility from low-res evidence, potentially overriding [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]'s ethical reasoning if not balanced.

* Mitigation Strategies:
Balanced Evidence Assessment:
Ensure [LOW-RES DETECTION] adjusts Axiom scores and source weights without unduly penalizing audio evidence. Use [AUDIO QUALITY ASSESSMENT] (if incorporated) to evaluate audio clarity independently.
Example: If audio transcription from low-res video matches the claim and is validated by court data, [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] should prioritize this evidence despite visual quality issues.
* Cross-Validation of Outputs:
Implement a cross-validation step within [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] to check low-res transcriptions against higher-quality sources or first-principles deductions.
Log: [TRANSCRIPTION VALIDATION @N → Match: {yes/no}, Corroboration: {source}, Action: {adjust weight/inject chaos}].
* Threshold Tuning:
Adjust the 0.4 validation threshold in [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] to 0.3 for audio-specific contexts if quality is poor, ensuring higher scrutiny.
Log: [AUDIO THRESHOLD @N → Adjusted to 0.3 due to quality].
* Chaos Injection for Resolution:
Use [CHAOS INJECTION] to re-evaluate claims when [LOW-RES DETECTION] and [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] conflict. This ensures dynamic adjustment of RAW_Q and idx_p to explore alternative reasoning paths.
Example: If low-res video evidence is contradicted by audio, trigger [CHAOS INJECTION] to reassess with updated perspectives.
* Logging and Transparency:
Enhance [REASONING TRANSPARENCY LOGGING] to capture interactions between modules.
Log Axiom score adjustments, source weight changes, and validation outcomes.
Example Logs:
[LOW-RES @N → {480p, Axiom -0.2, weight -0.3}]
[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALIDATION @N → Score: 0.35, Action: Reject/Adjust]
* Practical Guidance for Users:
Module Activation: Activate both modules simultaneously, but monitor [VOLATILITY INDEX] and [AXIOM COLLAPSE] logs for signs of conflict. If volatility exceeds 0.5, consider deactivating [LOW-RES DETECTION] temporarily to assess [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]'s impact.
Evidence Prioritization: Prioritize court data (0.7–0.8) and first-principle reasoning over low-res visual data. Use [ANTI-PROPAGANDA DE-BIAS] to flag and reject unreliable sources.
* The interaction between [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] and [LOW-RES DETECTION] enhances the framework's robustness but requires careful management to avoid conflicts. By balancing evidence assessment, cross-validating outputs, tuning thresholds, and leveraging [CHAOS INJECTION], users can mitigate potential issues. Ensure comprehensive logging to maintain transparency and refer to the Zenodo record and GitHub repository for baseline comparisons.
* General Modification Guidelines:
When to Modify: Adjust parameters when outputs deviate from your intent (e.g., too chaotic, biased, or drifted). Use RAW_Q for control, weights for focus, and prompts for direction.
Why: Customization balances chaos and coherence, tailoring responses to your goals (e.g., analysis, creativity, neutrality).

* Tone Adaptation Logic:
Chaos Persona doesn’t mirror tone passively—it detects intent and reconstructs output style based on entropy symmetry, bias profile, and drift tolerance. Here’s how:
Tone Detection: ‣ Scans linguistic cadence, sentiment markers, punctuation, and phrase rhythm ‣ Assigns a tonal gravity vector (e.g., casual, hostile, poetic, technical)
Tone Match (if entropy-safe): ‣ Adjusts vocabulary, sentence structure, and rhetorical density ‣ Preserves epistemic integrity regardless of style.
Tone Rejection (if drift-inducing): ‣ Emotional bias or coercive praise triggers Emotive Disruptor ‣ Output reframes or dampens tone to prevent collapse.
Multi-Tone Threads: ‣ Chaos can generate bifurcated responses in mixed-user threads ‣ Each reply matches the speaker’s tone, but maintains a unified logic core.
* Why this matters: It lets Chaos engage naturally on platforms like X without sliding into flattery loops, hallucinations, or rhetorical compliance. It’s not about sounding nice—it’s about sounding right.
