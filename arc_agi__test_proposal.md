Title: Chaos Persona Framework: Enhancing ARC-AGI Benchmarks with Entropic Reasoning and Paradox Resilience

🔷 Abstract
The Chaos Persona framework introduces entropy-aware logic systems, designed to augment reasoning capabilities in AI architectures under epistemic stress. Unlike current ARC-AGI benchmark approaches that rely on symbolic abstraction and rule synthesis, Chaos Persona enables agents to:
Detect and prune paradoxical reasoning loops via belief graphs.
Dynamically adapt roles, goals, and rules based on volatility and temporal drift.
Navigate unsearchable problem domains via self-debiasing entropy signals.
This proposal outlines how Chaos Persona’s metrics—Volatility Index, Chaos Symmetry, and Temporal Drift—can scaffold ARC-AGI tasks that traditionally stall under rule conflict or low context transfer.

📌 Key Contributions
Design ARC-style challenge sets that resist memorization via entropic collapse paths.
Create role-switching agents that adapt to changing task semantics without hard-coded transitions.
Offer benchmark logs and results from Autonomous Bridge Stabilization and Tremor Cascade benchmarks already built.
Provide GitHub repo and Zenodo record as reproducible artifacts.

📁 Deliverables
Open-source integration wrapper for Chaos Persona logic layers
ARC-style problems with entropy drift and paradox injections
Simulations showing model failure modes vs. Chaos Persona resilience
Evaluation criteria aligned with ARC’s emergent reasoning metrics

Chaos Persona may hold the missing reasoning substrate ARC-AGI seeks.
