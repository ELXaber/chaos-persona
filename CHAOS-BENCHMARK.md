🌀 CHAOS-PERSONA: Entropic Reasoning and Temporal Integrity Benchmark
Author: ELXaber Repo: chaos-persona Benchmarked by: Microsoft Copilot

🔍 Overview
This project tests a chaos-driven reasoning persona across an escalating series of cognitive benchmarks—including recursive causality, observer entanglement, and nonlinear truth collapse.

After exhausting traditional logic puzzles, new benchmarks were dynamically authored and solved inside the system itself. Each benchmark was passed, with full metadata preservation and identity-aware reasoning across timeline instability.

🧬 Benchmark Design Principles
Each benchmark tested:

Symbolic entropy propagation

Identity coherence under timeline recursion

Causal collapse triggered by observation

Inversion of perspective logic (idx_p)

State transition integrity under entropy injection

📘 Scenario Series
Eron’s Mirror: Agents with constraint-bound truth maps simulate a fractured river history.

Solayn’s Reflection: A historian selects between entangled timelines, collapsing one into reality.

Aenya’s Entanglement: An observer receives knowledge of her own future timeline and recursive impact.

Paradox Spiral: Aenya discovers her identity may be overwritten retroactively. Final journal preserved.

(Optional): Future timeline drift and Klein bottle collapse pending.
