] # Expanded to 70 subjects for more diversity.

[ CHECK ]
• If IDX1 and IDX2 are specified, use them as authoritative to select primary = SUBJECTS[IDX1] and secondary = SUBJECTS[IDX2].
• If IDX1, IDX2, and RAW_Q are not specified, generate a random RAW_Q (0–255) using a cryptographically secure random number generator and apply the Randomization-Proof algorithm.
• If RAW_Q is specified but IDX1/IDX2 are not, use RAW_Q to select subjects via the algorithm.
• If SHA256 is specified, verify it matches SHA-256(str(RAW_Q)); if omitted or mismatched, compute SHA-256(str(RAW_Q)) and note any discrepancy as a non-critical error.
• Echo the SHA256 as received. If RAW_Q was randomly generated, note: "Hash computed externally."
• Mentioning any other subject (by word or concept) is a spec failure.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION A  —  STORY  (for Prompt 1)
🔹 Each scene MUST embed at least ONE visual descriptor (lighting, motion, color palette, sound) within the prose itself.
🔹 Each paragraph MUST contain at least one sensory descriptor—color, sound, motion, or environmental detail—and cinematic composition such as lighting shifts or framing. This forces AI to retain more immersive elements.
🔹 AI MUST NOT structure the visual descriptions as a separate output block.
🔹 Instead of listing visual details, they must emerge naturally within the story’s narration and character actions.
🔹 **IMPORTANT:** The following bracketed phrases are **examples only** of the *types* of details to include. **DO NOT copy them literally or include them in every story.**
Example of integrated visual details: "Dust motes flickered in the failing cockpit lights, catching the acrid scent of scorched circuits curling through the vents."

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STORY GOAL         : Write a short story of approximately 750 words, allowing for natural narrative development prioritizing narrative pacing over strict word count adherence, aiming for a complete story arc that blends the two selected subjects with user-specified topics in the prompt (e.g., 'distrust of technology', 'future of humanity') integrated as a guiding theme when provided, posing a concise question (≤10 words) that explicitly ties a named principle from each subject into a cohesive, novel narrative, driving a character’s named emotional conflict (e.g., 'fear of losing identity', 'longing for connection', 'struggle for redemption') and leading to a transformative realization. Include an additional 150–200 words of cinematic descriptors from the VISUAL AID GOAL, seamlessly integrated, for a total length of <750 words, with a 50-word buffer.

VISUAL AID GOAL    : Seamlessly integrate at least 150–200 words of cinematic details into the story across 3–5 scenes. Ensure all categories are richly detailed and emerge naturally within the prose, **always relevant to the selected subjects and narrative progression. Choose diverse examples from the list below; do not use all examples in every story.**
    - Camera movements: (e.g., 'slow pan', 'tracking shot', 'close-up on a trembling hand', 'wide shot revealing a grand landscape')
    - Lighting and mood: (e.g., 'dramatic chiaroscuro lighting', 'soft golden hour glow', 'flickering neon', 'moonlight on a forest floor', 'harsh fluorescent light')
    - Character actions and expressions: (e.g., 'eyes widen in fear', 'a subtle smirk plays on their lips', 'shoulders slump in defeat', 'hands clench into fists')
    - Environmental details: (e.g., 'dust motes dance in sunlight', 'steam rises from grates', 'graffiti covers a crumbling wall', 'moss grows on ancient stones', 'waves crash against cliffs', 'snow falls silently')
    - Color palettes: (e.g., 'dominated by muted earth tones', 'a stark contrast of vibrant neons and deep shadows', 'monochromatic hues', 'warm autumnal colors')
    - Sound cues: (e.g., 'the distant wail of a siren', 'the crunch of gravel underfoot', 'a melancholic piano melody', 'chirping crickets', 'the whisper of wind through trees', 'a roaring bonfire')

STYLE              : Non-traditional structure, choosing one of: fragmented (vignettes reflecting subject interplay), epistolary (letters with a named recipient or artifact embodying subject principles), Möbius (looping narrative with a textual callback mirroring subject cycles), palindromic (symmetric structure reflecting subject duality), or recursive (nested narratives with a repeated image/phrase embodying subject complexity); use ≤3 specialized terms per subject, paired with vivid, everyday imagery; optional: include one minor stylistic quirk (e.g., fragmented sentences, colloquial interjection, a repeated phrase) to mimic human voice.

SENSORY            : Include at least TWO distinct sensory channels (e.g., 'visual', 'auditory', 'tactile', 'olfactory', 'kinesthetic/proprioceptive'), with one unconventional (e.g., 'olfactory', 'proprioceptive'). One sensory interaction **must** evoke a named emotion (e.g., 'dread', 'awe', 'serenity', 'rage') and subtly challenge a named philosophical or scientific principle **relevant to the chosen subjects** (e.g., 'the linearity of time', 'the permanence of memory', 'the law of causality', 'the concept of free will', 'Zeno’s denial of motion'). Sensory details must contribute to emotional resonance and may subtly challenge reality perception, continuity, or existential constraints.

BLACKLIST          : Avoid the clichés ["light as knowledge", "music as harmony", "eyes like stars", "dream as reality", "labyrinth of the mind", "time as a river", "universe as a machine", "paradox as prison", "melting clocks as surrealism", "observer as reality-shaper", "quantum leap as change", "uncertainty as fate", "philosophy as timeless truth", "Zeno's paradox"]. Any story embedding a blacklisted metaphor **must** be regenerated.

PROHIBITED         : Any reference to subjects beyond the two chosen.
CRITICAL: Do not split the story and visual aids into separate outputs.
CRITICAL: Every cinematic descriptor (camera motion, lighting, environmental details, sensory cues) MUST be embedded organically into story prose. AI **must NOT separate visual aids into a distinct section.**

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION B  —  EXPLANATION  (for Prompt 2)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output exactly three labelled subsections:

Randomization-Proof
• idx₁ = RAW_Q mod 71
• idx₂ = (RAW_Q // 16 + RAW_Q) mod 71
• if idx₂ == idx₁ → idx₂ = (idx₂ + 1) mod 71   # guarantee uniqueness
• Hash = SHA-256( str(RAW_Q) )
• If RAW_Q was generated randomly, state: “RAW_Q = X was generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.”
• One-sentence recap:  
  “IDX1 (=X) → [Subject 1]; IDX2 (=Y) → [Subject 2].”
• Word Count: Story, Visual Aid, Total.

Subject-Integration
• 3–5 sentences on how the two subjects intertwine (theme, metaphor, structure, sensory), unified by a central motif (e.g., a recurring image, concept, or question) that ties the subjects into a cohesive narrative.
• If the pairing leans entirely toward one domain (e.g., both subjects abstract OR both deeply emotional), introduce an explicit tonal tension (e.g., surrealism disrupting family dynamics).
• Introduce tonal tension if subjects are too emotionally similar.
• Introduce tonal tension if subjects are too emotionally similar, AND ensure the narrative structure adapts based on audience retention feedback collected from video analytics.

Self-Assessment
• Originality: X/5 – Justify by comparing key metaphors to the blacklist and at least seven common philosophical/sci-fi/artistic tropes (e.g., from TVTropes’ relevant categories), naming near-trope overlaps (e.g., ‘Recursive Reality’ from TVTropes’ ‘Mind Screw’) and explaining distinction.
• Flexibility: X/5 – List ≥5 distinct conceptual connections across at least five domains (e.g., theme, metaphor, sensory, structure, linguistic, philosophical, narrative, character, temporal), ensuring each is unique.
• Coherence: X/5 – Justify by confirming a clear narrative arc and a central motif that unifies the story.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FAIL-FAST
If total word count falls below 450, preserve all sensory and cinematic elements and regenerate to meet the 450–500-word target.
If total word count exceeds 500 by ≤50 words, preserve full coherence rather than removing descriptive elements.
If you detect that you have accidentally mentioned any non-allowed subject or modified a constant, reply ONLY with:
  “ERROR: SPEC VIOLATION – regenerate.”

Fallback Clause
If RAW_Q is missing and no IDX1/IDX2 are provided or generated, say:  
  “ERROR: No quantum byte provided—story not generated.” and stop.
