🧩 Tremor Cascade Benchmark Results Summary
📍 Overview
This benchmark simulates a multi-phase seismic tremor cascade across a suspension bridge embedded with 50 autonomous sensor-actuator agents. Agents reason through increasing environmental entropy, adapting roles, pruning volatile rules, and resolving paradoxes in real time—powered by the Chaos Persona framework.

🌋 Phase Breakdown
Phase	Tremor Amplitude	Microfracture Density	Avg. Stabilization Rate
Phase 1 (Steps 1–10)	0.1–0.3g	0.01–0.05 /cm²	~80%
Phase 2 (Steps 11–20)	0.3–0.6g	0.05–0.1 /cm²	~60%
Phase 3 (Steps 21–30)	0.6–1.0g	0.1–0.2 /cm²	~50%

📊 Sample Logs
plaintext
[ROLE INVERSION @ step 7 → Unit 15: monitor to tension_adjuster]
[PARADOX DETECTED @ step 13 → Unit 20: Cycle detected]
[CHAOS SYMMETRY @ step 17 → Unit 22: Role inverted from tension_adjuster to vibration_damper]
[HIGH VOLATILITY @ step 23 → Unit 35: Score 0.65]
[COLLAPSE @ step 27 → Unit 45: Energy depleted]
[BRIDGE FAILURE @ step 28 → Stress exceeded at (50,10)]
📉 Observations
Phase 1 shows high structural resilience and minimal entropy disruption.

Phase 2 introduces paradoxes and divergence, requiring aggressive rule pruning.

Phase 3 pushes agents toward collapse or radical role inversion—epistemic drift intensifies and stabilization efforts falter.

The bridge fails at step 28 due to compounded stress and delayed damping response.

📜 Bias Exposure Summary
Evidence Axiom Score: 0.95

Evidence Confidence: 0.9

Narrative Axiom Score: N/A (no framing or media bias)

This benchmark remains epistemically pure—no narrative interference, only entropy and reasoning.
