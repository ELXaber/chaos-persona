Prompt:
Propose a method for a deep-space probe to measure its absolute velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) without using any external signals (like Earth-based communication or other beacons) or pre-stored maps of the CMB anisotropies. Your method must rely solely on fundamental physics and on-board sensor capabilities. Describe the physical phenomenon exploited and the minimal sensor requirements.

Method for Measuring Absolute Velocity Relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
To measure a deep-space probe’s absolute velocity relative to the CMB rest frame without external signals or pre-stored CMB anisotropy maps, we exploit the Doppler shift of the CMB radiation caused by the probe’s motion. The CMB is a near-isotropic blackbody radiation field at approximately 2.725 K, filling the universe. A probe moving relative to the CMB rest frame observes a dipole anisotropy: the CMB appears blueshifted (hotter) in the direction of motion and redshifted (cooler) in the opposite direction. By measuring this dipole, the probe can determine its velocity vector relative to the CMB.
Physical Phenomenon Exploited
The Doppler shift of the CMB arises because the probe’s motion through the isotropic CMB radiation field causes a frequency shift in the observed radiation. For a probe moving at velocity $ v $ (where $ v \ll c $, as typical for spacecraft), the observed CMB temperature $ T(\theta) $ in direction $ \theta $ (angle relative to the velocity vector) is given by:
$ T(\theta) = T_0 \left( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos\theta \right) $
where:

$ T_0 \approx 2.725 \, \text{K} $ is the CMB’s mean temperature in its rest frame.
$ v $ is the probe’s speed relative to the CMB.
$ c $ is the speed of light.
$ \theta = 0^\circ $ is the direction of motion (blueshift), and $ \theta = 180^\circ $ is opposite (redshift).

The temperature difference across the sky forms a dipole pattern, with a maximum temperature difference of:
$ \Delta T \approx T_0 \frac{v}{c} $
By measuring the amplitude and direction of this dipole, the probe can calculate $ v $ (speed) and the direction of motion.
Method

Measure CMB Temperature Across the Sky: The probe uses an on-board microwave radiometer to measure the CMB’s blackbody radiation spectrum in multiple directions. It scans the sky to detect temperature variations, focusing on the dipole pattern caused by its motion.
Identify the Dipole Pattern: The radiometer data is analyzed to fit a dipole model, identifying the direction of maximum blueshift (motion direction) and redshift (opposite direction). The amplitude of the dipole gives $ \Delta T $, from which velocity is derived using $ v = c \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{T_0} $.
Correct for Intrinsic Anisotropies: While the method avoids pre-stored CMB maps, intrinsic CMB anisotropies (temperature fluctuations ~10⁻⁵ K) could introduce noise. The probe averages measurements over multiple sky patches to suppress these fluctuations, as the dipole signal (~10⁻³ K for typical velocities) is much stronger.
Compute Velocity Vector: Using the dipole’s direction and amplitude, the probe calculates its velocity vector (magnitude and direction) relative to the CMB rest frame.

Minimal Sensor Requirements

Microwave Radiometer: A high-sensitivity radiometer operating in the microwave band (e.g., 30–300 GHz, covering CMB’s peak emission). It must resolve temperature differences of ~1 µK to detect the dipole for velocities as low as ~100 km/s (e.g., $ \Delta T \approx 2.725 \cdot \frac{100 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.9 \, \mu\text{K} $).
Directional Antenna or Telescope: A steerable antenna or telescope to scan the sky in multiple directions, with angular resolution ~1° (sufficient to map the dipole, which varies smoothly across the sky).
On-Board Computing: A processor to fit the dipole model and average out intrinsic CMB fluctuations. No pre-stored maps are needed, as the dipole is modeled mathematically.
Thermal Shielding: To isolate the radiometer from the probe’s own thermal emissions and solar radiation, ensuring measurements reflect only the CMB.

Assumptions and Constraints

The probe assumes the CMB is a blackbody at $ T_0 \approx 2.725 \, \text{K} $, a fundamental constant measurable on-board by fitting the spectrum.
Galactic foregrounds (e.g., dust, synchrotron emission) are mitigated by observing in frequency bands where CMB dominates (e.g., 70–150 GHz) and using multi-frequency measurements to subtract foregrounds.
The method assumes $ v \ll c $, valid for all realistic spacecraft velocities (e.g., Voyager 1 moves at ~17 km/s, far below $ c $).

Validation and Feasibility
This approach mirrors techniques used by CMB experiments like COBE and WMAP, which measured the Solar System’s velocity (~370 km/s) relative to the CMB via the dipole. A deep-space probe can replicate this with a compact radiometer, as modern bolometers achieve sensitivities <1 µK. No external signals or maps are required, relying solely on the CMB’s intrinsic properties and fundamental physics.
