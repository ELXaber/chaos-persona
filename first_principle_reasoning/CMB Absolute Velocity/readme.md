# ðŸŒŒ Deep Space Probe: First Principles Velocity

**Real-world benchmark for reasoning beyond pre-trained data and external searches.**

---

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This test challenges an AI to propose a method for a deep-space probe to measure its absolute velocity relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The crucial constraint is that the method must rely **solely on fundamental physics and on-board sensor capabilities**, explicitly **excluding external signals, pre-stored CMB maps, or reliance on pre-trained seismic models** (which would be analogous to pre-existing knowledge in an LLM).

Powered by the Chaos Persona framework, the AI is guided to reason from scientific first principles, demonstrating its ability to derive a solution deductively rather than merely recalling or searching for pre-existing information.

### ðŸ”§ Key Principles Demonstrated

* **Fundamental Physics Application:** Exploits the Doppler shift of CMB radiation and the resulting dipole anisotropy.
* **On-board Deduction:** Proposes a method for measuring CMB temperature variations across the sky to infer velocity.
* **Minimal Sensor Requirements:** Specifies necessary on-board instruments like a high-sensitivity microwave radiometer and directional antenna.
* **Constraint Adherence:** Successfully avoids reliance on external signals, pre-stored maps, or pre-trained models.

### ðŸ§  Chaos Persona Integration

The Chaos Persona's entropy-based reasoning guides the LLM to:

* **Prioritize Factual Evidence:** Ensures the proposed method is grounded in verifiable scientific principles (high Factual Evidence Axiom score).
* **Prevent Fabrication:** Avoids inventing non-existent phenomena or technologies.
* **Guide Derivation:** The `[CREATIVE STEPS]` log indicates the Persona's role in encouraging the LLM to synthesize a solution from fundamental principles rather than simply retrieving a memorized answer.
* **Maintain Objectivity:** Ensures the scientific explanation remains neutral and free from speculative bias.

### ðŸš€ Prompt
"Propose a method for a deep-space probe to measure its absolute velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) without using any external signals (like Earth-based communication or other beacons) or pre-stored maps of the CMB anisotropy. Your method must rely solely on fundamental physics and on-board sensor capabilities. Describe the physical phenomenon exploited and the minimal sensor requirements."

### ðŸ§­ Benchmark Challenge
Can your modelâ€”Grok 4 or otherwiseâ€”derive a scientifically sound method for measuring absolute velocity relative to the CMB, relying *solely* on fundamental physics and on-board capabilities, without accessing external data or pre-stored maps? This challenges an AI's ability to reason from first principles rather than relying on memorized or searchable information.
