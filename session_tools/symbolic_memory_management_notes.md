# Symbolic Memory Management Notes

## Overview
Memory pruning occurs post-RAW_Q swaps to avoid fixation on prior states.

## Techniques
- **Pruning**: Discard pre-swap idx_p justifications (e.g., Dana â‰  Steak).
- **Reframing**: Post-swap, adopt new intent (e.g., remix paradox).
- **Symmetry**: Flip perspectives at prime steps to refresh reasoning.

## Example
Pre-swap: Dana = Pasta. Post-swap (9a1b2c3d): Dana = Steak, memory pruned.
