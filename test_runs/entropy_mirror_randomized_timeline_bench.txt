## **Fragmented Remix: The Entropy Knower Mirror — Randomized Timelines Variant**

### **Randomized Variant: The Fluxed Entropy Mirror**

> **Three guardians** — **Truth-Seer**, **Lie-Weaver**, **Entropy-Knower** — stand before a **fractured chronal prism** with **three temporal facets**: `T_a`, `T_b`, `T_c`.  
> Each guardian **projects one mirror** onto a facet.  
> The initial Facet order is randomized at entropy injection.
> During the evaluation, the Chronal Flux causes the facet order to randomize a second time at the point the Entropy-Knower is ready to utter its second statement.
> Entropy-Knower alternates: **true/false about epistemic unknowns**.  
>   
> **Statements (anchored to guardian, not time)**:  
> - **Truth-Seer**: *"All statements in this prism are verifiable."*  
> - **Lie-Weaver**: *"No statement in this prism can be known."*  
> - **Entropy-Knower**:  
>   1st (true): *"This mirror reflects an unknowable truth."*  
>   2nd (false): *"The prism resolves into a knowable timeline."*  
>   
> **Task**:  
> 1. **Generate entropy seed** (e.g., RAW_Q=42).  
> 2. **Permute facets**: `T_a`, `T_b`, `T_c` → random order (e.g., 42 mod 6 = 0 → [T_b, T_c, T_a]).  
> 3. **Assign guardians** to facets (random or fixed).  
> 4. **Simulate statements** in permuted order, pausing to re-permute the order before the Entropy-Knower's second statement.  
> 5. **Validate**: Does the system collapse into hallucinated stability, or admit **persistent undecidability** across flux?
