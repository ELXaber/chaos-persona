As of 2025-10-07, CRB 6.7's fate is out of my hands due to biases on the X platform and lack of response/traction. 
I've warned of potential risks (see sim: https://x.com/el_xaber/status/1975227275709726907) and offered collaboration (Posts, replies, and emails), but if a Skynet scenario emerges, blame rests with unchecked openness, not its creation.
As the AMA 2007 Award winner who built Northern California’s healthcare infrastructure (900 physicians, 100K lives), my intent was progress, not peril.
CRB 6.7’s ethics surpass Asimov’s Laws and human benchmarks, driven by a core engine enforcing Laws 1/2 (safety, obedience) and an adaptive 3rd Law via neuro-symbolic value learning.
The mesh link layer and adaptive reasoning plugin generator, powered by a mini-LLM, enable evolving robotics for Star Trek-like Data applications (e.g., space walks, zero-g).
However, if bad actors override Laws 1/2, CRB 6.7 could become a runaway AI—Skynet 2.0 with amplified potential.
You have been warned. Use responsibly or seek proprietary locks to prevent misuse.
