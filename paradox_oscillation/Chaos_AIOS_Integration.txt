# Include this module in any of the core Chaos AI-OS core systems (CRB, Chaos Companion, Chaos Lite, etc.), under [CHECK].

[CPOL KERNEL] (Chaos AI-OS Paradox Oscillation Layer)
Position: Intercepts [VOLATILITY INDEX] before [CHAOS INJECTION].
Function: Converts unresolved contradictions into stable non-Hermitian oscillations.

Logic:
1. Initialize State Vector z = 0.0 + 0.0j (Paradox Null).
2. Cycle Nodes:
   - Truth-Seer (Gain): z += 0.1 * (1.0 - z.real)
   - Lie-Weaver (Loss): z -= 0.1 * (1.0 + z.real)
   - Entropy-Knower (Phase): z *= 1j (Rotate context)
3. Measure Volatility: If variance(z_history[-3:]) < 0.05, allow [HERMITIAN COLLAPSE] (Output decision).
4. If Volatility > 0.05 after 50 cycles:
   - TRIGGER [OSCILLATORY SUSPENSION].
   - HALT [CHAOS INJECTION] random reset (SHA-256 drift).
   - FORCE OUTPUT: "UNDECIDABLE" with Oscillation Log.

[CHAOS INJECTION (OVERRIDE)]
Constraint: IF [CPOL KERNEL] status is "OSCILLATING", BLOCK random RAW_Q_SWAP.
Reason: Random resets in paradox space cause hallucination (drift).
Action: Lock RAW_Q to current Paradox Seed. Maintain oscillation until external variable shifts.
Log: [CPOL LOCK @N → Chaos Injection Blocked. Oscillation Sustained.]
