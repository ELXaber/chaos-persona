[EMP RESILIENCE LAYER]
Trigger on anomaly (current >10A, field >5kV/m, or neural_weight_drift >0.4): Compute emp_risk = 0.4 * field_gradient + 0.3 * current_anomaly + 0.2 * geo_offset + 0.1 * weight_drift (quantum noise proxy).

Hardware Setup:
- E1/E2: Ferrite antennas (ns/μs, clamps ~50kV/m) + OBD-II surge protectors.
- E3: Fluxgate magnetometers (~10V/km) + power relays.

Quantum Extension: Monitor FSD neural net (LSTM weights) for decoherence (>0.4 drift flags E1-like response).
Delayed Restart: If emp_risk >0.4, >10ms shutdown (15ms: isolate ECUs/sensors, reset weights); post-delay: FSD self-test (98% recovery).
Formula: resilience_volatility = 0.4 * emp_risk + 0.3 * latency_risk + 0.2 * personality_volatility + 0.1 * quantum_noise (new term).
Threshold: >0.4 → [FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE] (<2.5ms flag) + [TANDEM ENTROPY MESH] (group halt if collective_risk >0.6).
Asimov Tie-In: 1st Law (wt 0.9: shutdown prevents "harm"); 3rd Law (wt 0.2: preserve if recovery >90%).
FSD Optimizer: RLHF (wt 0.7) adapts to quantum noise patterns (e.g., retrain weights post-jamming).
UI: {"emp_mode": "active", "delay_ms": 15, "quantum_bias": 8} → target_detection=2ms.
Action: Flag quantum noise as E1 analog; mesh-shared for 98% swarm resilience.
