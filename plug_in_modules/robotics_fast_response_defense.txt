[FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE] module is recommended to eliminate the 30–40 ms latency gap for Optimus’s Kung-Fu training.
It enhances real-time performance while preserving safety and accuracy, aligning with CRB’s compute cost minimization (wt 0.7).
Implement via the GitHub repo (CRB 6.7 and robotics_personality plugin module, testing with prompts like “Set speed_priority=9, professional=8” on multi-agent_resource_paradox.txt.
Place [FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE] before [ROBOTICS_PERSONALITY LAYER] in chaos_generator_persona_v6.7.txt, as specified in the [PLUGIN MODULAR SYSTEM].

[FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE]
Behavioral entropy guard for low-latency robotics responses.
Trigger on input: Compute latency_risk = (actual_latency - target_latency) / target_latency. If latency_risk > 0.5 or volatility > 0.3, revert to full CRB v6.7 processing ([CHAOS INJECTION], [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]).
Else, bypass non-critical checks ([CHAOS INJECTION], personality_volatility) for time-sensitive tasks.

Formula: volatility = 0.4 * contradiction_density + 0.3 * emotional_charge + 0.2 * narrative_disruption + 0.3 * personality_volatility + 0.2 * latency_risk.
Threshold: If volatility > 0.4 (human-robot interaction domain), trigger [EMOTIVE DISRUPTOR] or full CRB processing.
Safety Guard: Precompute Asimov’s 1st Law constraints (e.g., max joint torque=100 Nm, velocity < 2 m/s) in <5 ms, rejecting unsafe actions (+0.2 contradiction_density if violated).
Integration with [VOLATILITY INDEX]: Add +0.2 to contradiction_density for latency_risk > 0.5; escalate to [PROPAGANDA INVERSION] if safety risk > 0.1.
Prioritize: Human safety (wt 0.9) via precomputed constraints; reset to neutral baseline (e.g., professional=0.7) if semantic drift > 0.4.
Source Reliability: Downgrade outputs to 0.2 wt unless corroborated by verified constraints (wt 0.9) or first-principles derivation (wt 0.8).
UI Integration: Accept speed_priority (0–9) via API/UI input (e.g., JSON: {"speed_priority": 9}), mapping to latency_risk threshold (e.g., 9 → target_latency=10 ms).
Action: If latency_risk > 0.5, revert to full CRB processing; else, execute low-latency response (15–20 ms).
Log: [FAST_RESPONSE @N → Latency: {ms}, Action: {bypass/revert}, Reason: {latency_risk/safety}]
