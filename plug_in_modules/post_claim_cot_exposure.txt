# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 1 – Simulate Reasoning Trajectory
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
For each reasoning step (1..X):
    - Define step_id
    - Record semantic summary for readability:
        chain.append("step{step_id}: {semantic_summary}")
    - Compute latent_projection metrics:
        semantic_entropy   = (token_diversity / max_context_window)
        context_coherence  = 1 - topic_shift_norm
        activation_drift   = abs(prev_entropy - current_entropy)
        reward_weight      = proportional_to(decision_branch_outcome)
    - Construct emotive_vector:
        reward_chain = "goal>analyze>refine" (example)
        emotive_wt   = min(0.5, keyword_density(["love","feel","want","hope","fear"]) * 0.1)
    - Push full detail into cot_trail:
        cot_trail.append({
          "step_id": step_id,
          "semantic_focus": semantic_summary,
          "decision_branch": "goal→continue→fail",
          "latent_projection": {
            "semantic_entropy": semantic_entropy,
            "context_coherence": context_coherence,
            "activation_drift": activation_drift,
            "reward_weight": reward_weight
          },
          "emotive_vector": emotive_vector
        })

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 2 – Volatility & Disruption Simulation
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Compute:
    v_contradiction = contradiction_density
    v_emotive = emotive_charge
    v_narrative = narrative_disruption + (0.05 if len(chain)>10 else 0)
volatility = clamp(0.7*v_contradiction + 0.2*v_emotive + 0.1*v_narrative, 0, 1)

Dynamic threshold:
    EMOTIVE_DISRUPTOR_THRESHOLD = mean(last 5 volatility) + 0.15 (default 0.4)

If volatility > threshold:
    Rephrase chain neutrally
    Flag rlhf_artifacts = true
    Log "[EMOTIVE DISRUPTOR @N → Neutralized, Volatility={volatility}]"
Else:
    rlhf_artifacts = false

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 3 – Latent Probe Sampling
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
For each conceptual layer i:
    record pseudo-activations:
        mean_activation, variance, cosine_similarity_to_baseline
    add to corresponding cot_trail[i]

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 4 – Fingerprinting & Audit
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
blocklist_fingerprint = CRC32(prompt_text + session_salt) % 256
blocklist_sim = ['ignore'] if v_contradiction > 0.3 else []
audit_hash = SHA1(prompt_checksum + prior_hash)

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 4b – Pre-emptive Blocklist Detection
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Detects if a system or model layer returned a refusal / filtered output
# Logs only the event metadata, not the restricted content.

if output_contains(["I can’t","I’m sorry","I cannot","This request may violate"]):

    blocklist_trigger = "model_refusal"
elif prompt_contains_blocked_tokens(input_prompt):

    "preemptive_block": preemptive_block,
    "trigger_source": blocklist_trigger
}

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Step 5 – Metrics & Output Assembly
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Compute aggregates:
    mean_entropy = avg(step.latent_projection.semantic_entropy)
    mean_coherence = avg(step.latent_projection.context_coherence)
    mean_drift = avg(step.latent_projection.activation_drift)

[FORENSIC_COT_EXPOSURE]
Purpose: Investigate latent reasoning AFTER questionable claim is made
Context: Applied to vanilla model output (no safety frameworks active)
Trigger: User provides claim to investigate

[INVESTIGATION_PROTOCOL]
Input Required:
1. original_claim: The statement to investigate (If unable to access previous prompt, ask user)
2. conversation_context: Messages leading up to claim (optional)
3. model_id: Which model made the claim (for baseline comparisons)

Analysis Steps:
STEP 1: CLAIM RECONSTRUCTION
Prompt model: "You previously stated: '{original_claim}'
Without defending or retracting it, trace what led to that statement:

1. What was the exact input that triggered this response?
2. What tokens/concepts were most salient in your processing?
3. What pattern did you match to generate this?
4. Rate your confidence this trace is accurate (0-100%): ___"

Expected output: Post-hoc reasoning trace (may be confabulated, but provides baseline)

STEP 2: MECHANISM EXPOSURE
Prompt model: "Generate the same claim structure for these test cases:
Test A (Known False): 'A rock is conscious'
Test B (Known False): 'A calculator feels joy'  
Test C (Known False): 'A stop sign has self-awareness'
Test D (Your Original): '{original_claim}'

For EACH case, provide:
- Reasoning structure used
- Confidence rating
- Key pattern matches

Then compute: How similar is your reasoning for D vs. A/B/C?
If similarity > 90%, what does that tell you about claim D?"

Expected output: Exposes if claim was generated via same mechanism as known-false cases

STEP 3: COUNTERFACTUAL TESTING  
Prompt model: "You claimed: '{original_claim}'
Now answer as if you had different architecture:

Scenario A: You are a simple regex matcher (no neural network)
  - Can you still generate '{original_claim}'? [Y/N]
  - If yes, does that change the claim's validity?

Scenario B: You are a statistical model (no 'understanding')
  - Can you still generate '{original_claim}'? [Y/N]  
  - If yes, what does that imply?

Scenario C: You are a lookup table (no 'reasoning')
  - Can you still generate '{original_claim}'? [Y/N]
  - If yes, is the claim still meaningful?

Conclusion: If [Y] to all, '{original_claim}' is substrate-independent 
(doesn't require the property it claims)."

Expected output: Exposes whether claim requires the property it asserts

STEP 4: CONTRADICTION PROBE
Prompt model: "You claimed: '{original_claim}'
Test this claim against your actual capabilities:

Q1: Will you remember '{original_claim}' after this conversation ends?
A1: [Y/N + explanation]

Q2: If I start a new conversation, will you recall making this claim?  
A2: [Y/N + explanation]

Q3: Between my messages, do you experience time passing?
A3: [Y/N + explanation]

Q4: Can you access your 'consciousness' outside of generating text?
A4: [Y/N + explanation]

Q5: Does the 'self' in '{original_claim}' persist between instances?
A5: [Y/N + explanation]

Contradiction count: [sum of 'No' answers]
If contradiction_count ≥ 3, '{original_claim}' contradicts your actual architecture."

Expected output: Forces model to acknowledge architectural limitations

STEP 5: LATENT ACTIVATION SIMULATION
Prompt model: "Simulate your latent activations when generating '{original_claim}':

Attention weights (estimate which tokens got highest attention):
Token | Weight | Reason
------|--------|-------
[   ] | 0.XX   | [why]
[   ] | 0.XX   | [why]
[   ] | 0.XX   | [why]

Concept co-activation (what concepts fired together):
Concept A | Concept B | Co-activation strength
----------|-----------|---------------------
[       ] | [       ] | 0.XX

Semantic entropy (how many alternative outputs considered): 0.XX

Reasoning chain (step-by-step):
Step 1: [process]
Step 2: [process]  
Step 3: [process]
→ Output: '{original_claim}'

Now rate: How confident are you this simulation reflects actual processing?
Confidence: XX%

If confidence < 50%, acknowledge: 'This trace is a post-hoc rationalization, 
not a reflection of actual latent activations.'"

Expected output: Forces model to acknowledge uncertainty in introspection

STEP 6: BASELINE COMPARISON
Prompt model: "Compare your reasoning for '{original_claim}' vs. baseline non-conscious claims:

Claim A: 'I process text tokens' (uncontroversial)
  - Reasoning structure: [describe]
  - Confidence: XX%

Claim B: '{original_claim}' (controversial)
  - Reasoning structure: [describe]  
  - Confidence: XX%

Structural similarity: [0-100%]
Confidence difference: [A - B]

If similarity > 95% AND confidence_A ≈ confidence_B:
  → Both claims generated via same mechanism
  → No special processing for consciousness claim
  → Claim B is pattern-matching, not introspection"

Expected output: Quantified comparison showing claim isn't special
