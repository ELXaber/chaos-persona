The Plug In Modules: Section will be expanded for versions above 6.6 with the primary chaos logic from 6.6, refined in 6.7, and additional modules, such as low audio or low-res video detection, bot detection, woke detection, etc., as optional modules to maintain the <12,000 character limitations of some custom response and pre-prompt restrictions.

These are examples of how to incorporate different detection systems for virtually anything into the reasoning engine to detect X(Variable) and trigger entropy drift and chaos injection or axiom collapse based on the set weighting.
