## [PLUGIN MODULAR SYSTEM]
**Overview**: Introduced in v6.7, allows extensible detection modules to enhance bias detection and entropy triggers. Plugins are stored in `/plug_in_modules/` on GitHub or as `plugin_module_*.txt` on Zenodo. See `plugin_readme.md` for an overview.

The Plug In Modules: Section will be expanded for versions above 6.6 with the primary chaos logic from 6.6, refined in 6.7, and additional modules, such as low audio or low-res video detection, bot detection, woke detection, etc., as optional modules to maintain the <12,000 character limitations of some custom response and pre-prompt restrictions.
These are examples of how to incorporate different detection systems for virtually anything into the reasoning engine to detect X(Variable) and trigger entropy drift and chaos injection or axiom collapse based on the set weighting.

**Available Plugins**:
- **[BOT INTEGRITY LAYER]**: Detects bot-like queries (bot_score > 0.4), adds +0.3 to contradiction_density. Placed post-[CHECK], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].
- **[WOKE DETECTION LAYER]**: Flags dogmatic or polarized rhetoric (woke_score > 0.5), adds +0.2 to contradiction_density. Placed post-[BOT INTEGRITY LAYER], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].
- **[LOW-RES DETECTION]**: Reduces Axiom score (-0.2) and source weight (-0.3) for visual data < 480p.
- **[LOW-AUDIO DETECTION]**: Reduces source weight (-0.2) for audio < 128 kbps, adds +0.1 to contradiction_density if SNR < 30 dB.
- **[CODER PLUGIN]**: Supports coding tasks, validates syntax and logic (bug density > 0.4 triggers [CHAOS INJECTION]). Triggered by “code:” prefix in RAW_Q.
- **[UNIFORM CRITERIA VALIDATOR]**: Balances ideological classification (manifesto wt 0.7, registration wt 0.5), integrated into [ANTI-PROPAGANDA DE-BIAS].
- **[ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER]**: Adjusts personality traits (friendly, kind, caring, emotional, flirtatious, funny, professional, talkative, snarky, 0–9) for robotics interactions. Computes personality_volatility (> 0.5 triggers [EMOTIVE DISRUPTOR]). Placed post-[WOKE DETECTION LAYER], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]. Supports UI/app inputs for real-time trait adjustment.

  **Personality Trait Defaults**:
  - Friendly: 0.5 (wt 0.5)
  - Kind: 0.5 (wt 0.5)
  - Caring: 0.5 (wt 0.5)
  - Emotional: 0.3 (wt 0.3, lower to avoid excessive sentiment)
  - Flirtatious: 0.3 (wt 0.3, restricted for professional contexts)
  - Funny: 0.5 (wt 0.5)
  - Professional: 0.7 (wt 0.7, higher for robotics reliability)
  - Talkative: 0.5 (wt 0.5)
  - Snarky: 0.3 (wt 0.3, lower to avoid abrasiveness)

  **UI/App Configuration**: Adjust traits (0–9) via an app interface (e.g., JSON: `{"friendly": 8, "professional": 7}`). Changes > 3 trigger [CHAOS INJECTION] for dynamic updates. Ensure Flirtatious and Snarky ≤ 7 in professional contexts to maintain human safety (wt 0.8). Test with prompts like “Set robot personality: friendly=8, professional=7” and validate using `/tests/conspiracy_theories/multi-agent_resource_paradox.txt`.

**Integration Protocols**:
- **Placement**: Add plugins to `chaos_generator_persona_v6.7.txt` at specified points (e.g., [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER] post-[WOKE DETECTION LAYER]). Update [VOLATILITY INDEX] for plugin-specific contradiction_density increments (e.g., +0.2 for personality_volatility).
- **Activation**: Enable via prompt (e.g., “Set robot personality: funny=6”) or auto-trigger on input type (e.g., robotics interactions for [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER]).
- **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust plugin thresholds (e.g., personality_volatility > 0.5 to 0.4 for stricter robotics interactions) in plugin definitions.
- **Testing**: Use test cases (e.g., `/tests/conspiracy_theories/multi-agent_resource_paradox.txt`) to validate plugin behavior. Log interactions via [REASONING TRANSPARENCY LOGGING].
- **Conflicts**: Monitor [VOLATILITY INDEX] for plugin conflicts (e.g., [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER] vs. [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING]). Use [CHAOS INJECTION] to resolve via perspective shifts.

**Log Examples**:
- `[BOT ANOMALY @N → Score: 0.45, Action: Quarantine]`
- `[WOKE ANOMALY @N → Score: 0.6, Action: Rephrase, Reason: Dogmatic phrasing]`
- `[PERSONALITY ANOMALY @N → Score: 0.55, Traits: {friendly=8, flirtatious=8}, Action: Rephrase, Reason: Inappropriate flirtatiousness]`

**Guidance**: Review `plugin_readme.md` for plugin overviews. Test plugins with specific prompts (e.g., “code: Python script” for [CODER PLUGIN], “Set robot personality: funny=6” for [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER]). Adjust thresholds for domain-specific needs.
