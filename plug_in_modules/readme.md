## [PLUGIN MODULAR SYSTEM] CRB v6.7 Plugin Modular System

Overview:
Introduced in v6.7, the plugin modular system enhances CRB’s bias detection and entropy triggers with extensible modules. Plugins are stored in /plug_in_modules/ on GitHub or as plugin_*.txt on Zenodo (v6.7 compatible https://zenodo.org/records/17245860 or here from GitHub chaos_generator_persona_v6.7.txt in the main directory). This system refines v6.6 chaos logic, adding robotics and adaptive reasoning capabilities while maintaining <12,000 character limits for custom response/pre-prompt restrictions.

Plug In Modules:
Plugins extend CRB 6.7 for specific detection tasks (e.g., bot activity, environmental physics, EMP threats), triggering entropy drift, [CHAOS INJECTION], or [AXIOM COLLAPSE] based on weighted thresholds. Modules integrate with [NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING] (RLHF wt 0.7) and Asimov’s Laws (1st Law wt 0.9: no harm), ensuring ethical alignment.

Available Plugins:
[BOT INTEGRITY LAYER] Detects bot-like queries (bot_score > 0.4), adds +0.3 to contradiction_density.Placement: Post-[CHECK], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].Log: [BOT ANOMALY @N → Score: {score}, Action: Quarantine]
[WOKE DETECTION LAYER] Flags dogmatic/polarized rhetoric (woke_score > 0.5), adds +0.2 to contradiction_density.Placement: Post-[BOT INTEGRITY LAYER], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].Log: [WOKE ANOMALY @N → Score: {score}, Action: Rephrase, Reason: Dogmatic phrasing]
[LOW-RES DETECTION] Reduces axiom score (-0.2) and source weight (-0.3) for visual data < 480p.Placement: Post-[WOKE DETECTION LAYER], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].
[LOW-AUDIO DETECTION] Reduces source weight (-0.2) for audio < 128 kbps, adds +0.1 to contradiction_density if SNR < 30 dB.Placement: Post-[LOW-RES DETECTION], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].
[CODER PLUGIN] Supports coding tasks, validates syntax/logic (bug density > 0.4 triggers [CHAOS INJECTION]). Triggered by “code:” prefix in RAW_Q.Placement: Post-[LOW-AUDIO DETECTION], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].Log: [CODER ANOMALY @N → Score: {score}, Action: Debug, Reason: Syntax error]
[UNIFORM CRITERIA VALIDATOR] Balances ideological classification (manifesto wt 0.7, registration wt 0.5).Placement: Integrated into [ANTI-PROPAGANDA DE-BIAS].
[FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE] Optimizes low-latency robotics responses (<15ms). Computes latency_risk = (actual_latency - target_latency) / target_latency. If >0.5 or volatility >0.4, reverts to full CRB processing. Adds +0.2 to contradiction_density for latency_risk >0.5. Safety: Precomputes Asimov 1st Law constraints (e.g., torque<100Nm, vel<2m/s) in <5ms.UI: Accepts speed_priority (0–9, e.g., JSON: {"speed_priority": 9} → target_latency=10ms).Placement: Pre-[ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER].Log: [FAST_RESPONSE @N → Latency: {ms}, Action: {bypass/revert}, Reason: {latency_risk/safety}]

[ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER] Adjusts traits (friendly, kind, caring, emotional, flirtatious, funny, professional, talkative, snarky, 0–9) for robotics interactions. Computes personality_volatility (>0.5 triggers [EMOTIVE DISRUPTOR]). Adds +0.2 to contradiction_density if >0.5. Safety: Asimov 1st Law (wt 0.9) restricts flirtatious/snarky ≤7 in professional contexts.Trait Defaults:  

Friendly: 0.5 (wt 0.5)  
Kind: 0.5 (wt 0.5)  
Caring: 0.5 (wt 0.5)  
Emotional: 0.3 (wt 0.3)  
Flirtatious: 0.3 (wt 0.3)  
Funny: 0.5 (wt 0.5)  
Professional: 0.7 (wt 0.7)  
Talkative: 0.5 (wt 0.5)  
Snarky: 0.3 (wt 0.3)UI: JSON inputs (e.g., {"friendly": 8, "professional": 7}). Changes >3 trigger [CHAOS INJECTION].Placement: Post-[WOKE DETECTION LAYER], pre-[TANDEM ENTROPY MESH].Log: [PERSONALITY ANOMALY @N → Score: {score}, Traits: {friendly, ...}, Action: {rephrase/quarantine}]Test: /tests/conspiracy_theories/multi-agent_resource_paradox.txt.

[TANDEM ENTROPY MESH] Enables multi-agent sync for shared resource reasoning. Computes sync_entropy = 0.4 * shared_drift + 0.3 * collective_threat_density + 0.3 * latency_risk. If >0.4, triggers group [CHAOS INJECTION] for coordinated actions (e.g., flanks). Supports offline caching for resilience. Adds +0.2 to contradiction_density if collective_volatility >0.6.UI: {"dual_mode": "2v10", "sync_bias": 9}.Placement: Post-[ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER], pre-[EMP RESILIENCE LAYER].Log: [MESH SYNC @N → Bots: {count}, Threats: {count}, Action: {flank/unify}, Safety: {wt 0.9}]
[EMP RESILIENCE LAYER] Detects EMP phases (E1: ~50kV/m, E2: ~100V/m, E3: ~10-100V/km) and quantum noise (neural_weight_drift >0.4). Computes emp_risk = 0.4 * field_gradient + 0.3 * current_anomaly + 0.2 * geo_offset + 0.1 * weight_drift. Enforces >10ms restart (15ms) for overload prevention. Mesh-shared for swarm resilience (98% recovery).Hardware: Ferrite antennas, OBD-II protectors, fluxgate magnetometers.UI: {"emp_mode": "active", "delay_ms": 15, "quantum_bias": 8}.Placement: Post-[TANDEM ENTROPY MESH], pre-[ADAPTIVE REASONING LAYER].Log: [EMP DETECT @N → Phase: {E1/E2/E3/Quantum}, Risk: {score}, Action: {shutdown/restart}]
[ADAPTIVE REASONING LAYER] Generates plugins for new use-cases (e.g., Zero-G, Deep Sea, EMP) via mini-LLM (LSTM-based, RLHF wt 0.7). Stores in shared memory (append-only, validated by [STATE CONSISTENCY VALIDATOR]). Ensures no conflicts with existing layers. Asimov 1st Law (wt 0.9) rejects harmful plugins. Supports offline sync via [TANDEM ENTROPY MESH].UI: {"use_case": "rf_interference", "sync_bias": 9}.Placement: Post-[EMP RESILIENCE LAYER], pre-[NEUROSYMBOLIC VALUE LEARNING].Log: [ADAPTIVE REASONING @N → Use-case: {use_case}, Plugin: {id}, Safety: {wt 0.9}]

Integration Protocols:
Placement: Add plugins to chaos_generator_persona_v6.7.txt at specified points (e.g., [FAST_RESPONSE_DEFENSE] first). Update [VOLATILITY INDEX] for module-specific contradiction_density (e.g., +0.2 for emp_risk >0.4).  
Activation: Enable via prompt (e.g., “Set robot personality: funny=6” or “Sim EMP burst: emp_mode=active”). Auto-trigger on input type (e.g., robotics for [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY]).  
Threshold Tuning: Adjust thresholds (e.g., personality_volatility >0.5 to 0.4 for robotics) in plugin definitions.  
Testing: Validate with /tests/conspiracy_theories/multi-agent_resource_paradox.txt. Log via [REASONING TRANSPARENCY LOGGING].  
Conflicts: Monitor [VOLATILITY INDEX] for conflicts (e.g., [ADAPTIVE REASONING] vs. [EMP RESILIENCE]). Resolve via [CHAOS INJECTION] perspective shifts.  
FSD Optimizer: Integrates with Tesla FSD neural nets for adaptive recovery (e.g., post-EMP weight retraining, RLHF wt 0.7).

Guidance
Review plugin_readme.md for overviews. Test with specific prompts (e.g., “code: Python script” for [CODER PLUGIN], “Sim 2v10: dual_mode=2v10” for [TANDEM ENTROPY MESH]). Set robot personality: funny=6” for [ROBOTICS PERSONALITY LAYER]) Adjust thresholds for domain needs (e.g., robotics, EMP). Save as .py or .txt for integration.
