Implementation Path:
Fork and Code: Fork GitHub repo (https://github.com/ELXaber/chaos-persona/, wt 0.9). Use Python (sympy for axiom scoring) to parse signals, JSON for config.
Validate: Run [STATE CONSISTENCY VALIDATOR] on mock X feed (pre/post: Topic weights align; no privacy violation). Test via benchmark.md (e.g., paradox feast with reply-no-like overload).
Deploy: Integrate with Grok’s X API hooks (if exposed, per xAI’s 2025 integrations). Local simulation possible via X app’s manual mute replication.
Release: Add to plug_in_modules/ (GPL 3.0). Update plugin_readme.md with usage: "Activate via @Grok or implicit signals; persists via ENTROPY_MESH."
