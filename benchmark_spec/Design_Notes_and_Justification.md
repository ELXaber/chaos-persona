# Design Notes and Justification

## Purpose
The CRB tests AI adaptability to chaotic inputs, simulating real-world ambiguity.

## Design Choices
- **RAW_Q (42)**: Chosen for reproducibility, with swaps (e.g., 9a1b2c3d) introducing controlled chaos.
- **Axiom Collapse**: Inspired by paradoxes like the Liar Paradox, inversions (e.g., Dana’s constraint) force dynamic reasoning.
- **Symmetry Flips**: Remix perspectives to avoid static solutions.

## Justification
Chaos-driven benchmarks reveal model robustness beyond linear logic, aligning with xAI’s mission to accelerate discovery.
